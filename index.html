                <h2>Regular Clearing and Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Periodically remove dry, dead, and fallen bamboo from the plantation. This includes pruning bamboo culms, clearing underbrush, and removing leaf litter to reduce fuel for fires.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='strategic-irrigation.html';">
                <h2>Implement Strategic Irrigation</h2>
                <p>Keep the bamboo hydrated, especially during dry seasons, to increase moisture content in the plants. Drip irrigation or sprinkler systems can ensure the bamboo and the soil remain moist, making them less susceptible to ignition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='maintain-firebreaks.html';">
                <h2>Create and Maintain Firebreaks</h2>
                <p>Establish wide, cleared strips around the plantation and between sections of bamboo. These firebreaks act as barriers to slow or stop the spread of fire.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='Fire-Resistant-Companion-Planting.html';">
                <h2>Choose Fire-Resistant Companion Planting</h2>
                <p>Plant fire-resistant species around the bamboo plantation and as part of the understorey. Such plants can provide an additional layer of protection against fire spread.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='Implement-Early-Detection-and-Monitoring.html';">
                <h2>Implement Early Detection and Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Install smoke detectors and fire watch towers in and around the plantation. Regular patrols during high-risk periods can help in early detection of fires, allowing for quicker response to prevent spread..</p>
